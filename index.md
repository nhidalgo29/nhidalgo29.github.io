# Nathaniel Rommel Hidalgo's Portfolio
My name is Nathaniel Rommel Hidalgo and I'm currently majoring in computer science at California State University Fullerton. I expect to graduate in 2027 and at least have some experience that'll also help me land a good paying job in the computer science field.

## CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 7, Part 2

Lab 7, part 2 was one of the most difficult lab parts to complete, especially after debugging and fixing any errors within the code. Overall, the lab was enjoyable to work with, especially with my partner as the finished result is just worth it and beautiful at the end.

* Lab 8, Part 1

Part 1 of this lab was very fun to code and test out. It was nice using if statements and for loops. It was also fun using some math when including it in the code.

* Lab 10, Part 2

Lab 10, part 2 was really challenging but worth the finished result of completing the lab and successfully testing out the code. This lab was still fun to code in the end.
